 # Async Scrum Hub – API Contract

## Overview

This document defines the HTTP API contract for the Async Scrum Hub backend.
It specifies available endpoints, request parameters, and response structures.
This document is framework-agnostic and serves as a reference for frontend and backend development.

---

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```
---
## Authentication

This API uses JWT-based authentication.
All endpoints (except public ones) require a valid JWT token sent in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```
---

## Roles & Permissions

This API uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model.
Permissions are scoped to specific resources (organization, task, ticket, etc.).

---

### Roles

### Organization Roles
- admin
	- Full control over the organization.
	- Can manage members and their roles.
	- Can create and manage tickets within the organization.
- member
	- Can access organizations they belong to.
	- Can participate in tickets and tasks within the organization.

### Scrum Roles (Organization-Level)
- scrum_master
	- Can create and manage tickets.
	- Can manage organization timeline and planning.
- product_owner
	- Manages product backlog and priorities.
- developer
	- Works on tasks and submits standups.

**Note:** Scrum roles are assigned per-organization and affect ticket management permissions.

### Role Inheritance

- Organization admins have full control over all resources within their organization.
- Scrum roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer) are assigned at the organization level.
- Permissions are always evaluated at the organization scope.

### Ownership Rules

- The creator of a resource (task, standup, blocker) becomes its owner.
- Resource owners can update or delete their own resources.
- Organization admins can manage all resources within their organization.
- The assigned user has full edit permissions over the resource (task or blocker), equivalent to the resource owner.
- Assigned user permissions only apply when the resource has an assigned user.
- If `assignee_id` is null, permissions related to the assigned user are ignored.

### Membership Management Rules

- Membership in organizations is managed exclusively by organization admins.
- Users cannot remove themselves from organizations.
- An organization must always have at least one organization admin.
- The last remaining admin of an organization cannot be removed or demoted.

---

### Common HTTP Status Codes (Used in this API)

- `200 OK` - Request successful
- `201 Created` - Resource created successfully
- `204 No Content` – Request successful, no response body
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request data (business logic errors)
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication required or invalid
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `409 Conflict` - Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate)
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Validation error (missing or invalid fields)
