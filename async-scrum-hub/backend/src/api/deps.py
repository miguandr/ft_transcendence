"""
FastAPI dependencies for authentication, context resolution, and authorization.

This module provides reusable dependencies that endpoints use to:
- Authenticate users via JWT tokens
- Verify organization membership
- Enforce permission checks before executing endpoint logic

Available dependencies:
- `get_current_user`: Extracts and validates the authenticated user from JWT token
- `require_org_member`: Verifies the user belongs to the organization (any role)
- `require_org_permission(action)`: Factory for endpoints with org_id in path
- `require_resource_permission(action, loader)`: Factory for endpoints that access resources directly

Usage examples:
	# For endpoints with org_id in path:
	@router.get("/organizations/{org_id}/members")
	def list_members(user: User = Depends(require_org_permission("members:list"))):
		...

	# For endpoints without org_id in path:
	@router.patch("/tickets/{ticket_id}")
	def update_ticket(ticket: Ticket = Depends(require_resource_permission("tickets:update", get_ticket))):
		...

"""
Simple membership check for endpoints where any organization member can access.
No role or permission checks - only verifies the user belongs to the organization.

Use this for endpoints like:
- GET /organizations/{org_id}/tickets (any member can list)
- GET /organizations/{org_id}/standups (any member can list)
- GET /organizations/{org_id}/blockers (any member can list)

"""
This helper is used by endpoints that are scoped to an organization,
i.e. endpoints that include an `org_id` in the path, for example:
- GET  /organizations/{org_id}/members

Calling `require_org_permission(action)` does NOT perform any authorization.
It only creates and returns another function (the real dependency).
The returned function is executed later, per request, by FastAPI and it returns
the User object.

This helper is used by endpoints that access a resource directly,

The loader is a FastAPI dependency that loads the resource from the database.
It should handle the 404 case if the resource doesn't exist.
